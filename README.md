# English-to-Spanish-Translation-using-Transformers
# Aim of the notebook.
Attention-based sequence-to-sequence model that can effectively understand the context of Spanish sentences and translate them into clear and coherent English sentences.

# Downloading the dataset

The dataset used is a paired corpus of **English-Spanish**, provided by [Anki](https://www.manythings.org/anki/).

The code starts by downloading a zip file containing the dataset for English to Spanish translation. The dataset is stored in the `spa-eng` folder and can be found in the file named `spa.txt`.

Let's take a look at how the data looks like:

- Each line in the `spa.txt` file contains an English word/sentence and their corresponding Spanish translation.

- Some words might have multiple translation because of context. 

- Our first objective is to extract each line, and then separate the  English and Spanish words/sentences into two separate arrays. These will act as our input and target sentences for training the model
